For e.g. Opium is converted to Heroin using Acetic Anhydride and manufacturing of Methamphetamine is done using Ephedrine or Pseudoephedrine. Precursor chemicals are essential in various legal industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, manufacturing etc., but their potential for misuse necessitates strict regulation and monitoring. Appreciating this, Government of India has put different levels of regulations on some of the precursor chemicals in India under the Regulation of Controlled Substances Order, 2013. 7 widely misused precursor chemicals are put under strictest of the controls, where in any firm dealing in any of these 7 chemicals are required to maintain records and file quarterly reports with jurisdictional NCB Zonal Unit. Any activity undertaken with respect to these chemicals like manufacture, possession, storage, sale, purchase, distribution, export, consumption etc are to be reported to NCB. Further, NCB also issues Unique Registration Number (URN) to the firms indulged in the said activities. If any individual or firm is found to be involved in any of the activities without a valid URN are punishable under the Narcotic Drugs and Controlled Substances Act, 1985.
Description: It is observed that some of the firms with valid URN to be handling any of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemical, divert the same from licit channel and traffic it for manufacturing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Further, the investigations conducted also reveal that the firms usually create documentation of the movement of precursor to a licit firm for a licit activity and divert the same for illicit activities. Therefore, there is a need for end-to-end tracking of the 7 domestically controlled precursor chemicals (controlled substances)

120,Ministry of Defence,"DDoS Protection System for Cloud: Architecture and Tool×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1649Problem Statement TitleDDoS Protection System for Cloud: Architecture and ToolDescriptionBackground:
Many organization are using Cloud for hosting their web applications. The attackers can try to attack these webservers for achieving Denial of Service attack. Specifically, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network of Cloud infrastructure by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems assources of attack traffic.
Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate security tools to counter and protect against these attacks.

├ö├ç├│ Description:
The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is that a website or service suddenly becomes slow or unavailable. But since a number of causes such a legitimate spike in traffic can create similar performance issues, further
investigation is usually required. Therefore, suitable analytics tools need to be developed to clearly identify an attack as DDoS.
Following are some of the patterns for a DDoS attack:
1. Suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or IP range
2. A flood of traffic from users who share a single behavioral profile, such as device type, geolocation, or web browser version
3. An unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint
4. Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unnatural (e.g. a spike every 10 minutes)
There are other, more specific signs of DDoS attack that can vary depending on the type of attack. The tool developer should be creative to consider other signs also.
For the above problem statements, following assumptions can be made:
1. Cloud is hosting a website and providing some services to its users.
2. The website should be always up and providing services to its users (high availability).
3. The attackers can flood the website directly or via other nodes (DDoS).
4. The attacker can also sabotage the link between a client and webserver.
5. The attack can come from outside or from within the cloud infrastructure.
A solution needs to be built by suitably designing the cloud architecture and developing some tool (s) to automatically detect and recover from the DDoS attack.

Expected Solution:
A set of developed tool(s) along with a suitable Cloud architecture to be demonstrated. The demonstrated website should be protected well against different types of DDoS attack. In case of an attack, the developed security tools
should be able to automatically detect and protect a website hosted on cloud infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The solution should also demonstrate the automatic recovery from the attack. As high availability is an essential feature, the down time (recovery time) should be minimized to the extent possible.OrganizationMinistry of DefenceDepartmentDefence Research and Devlopment Organisation (DRDO)CategorySoftwareThemeBlockchain & CybersecurityYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1649,Problem Statement Title,DDoS Protection System for Cloud: Architecture and Tool,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,security

In today├ö├ç├ûs digital age, a wide variety of services and processes take place online. Users of these digital facilities are required to upload government-issued containing documents or provide data for successfully availing the services. However, the uploaded documents or data which are required to facilitate these digital services and processes contain personally identifiable information (PII), i.e. any data that can be used to identify an individual uniquely. These documents can be like Aadhaar card, PAN, Credit Card, Driving License etc and can include data like names, address, phone number, email address, and financial information, among others of the user. The handling of PII is crucial as its exposure can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud among other cyber related issues.
Detailed Description:
The above problem statement envisages that an application be developed to identify whether PII, in the form of government-issued documents such as Aadhaar, Driving license, MHA-issued ID Cards, etc. is embedded in the uploaded document or provided data. Notable, the PII may be included inadvertently as well. PII, by its nature, is sensitive data, and its exposure must be protected against in order to safeguard users├ö├ç├û privacy. Entities and organizations handling documents or data containing users├ö├ç├û PII must be mindful of the complex challenges that arise with it ├ö├ç├┤ they have to balance data storage, encryption, access controls, data retention policies, data management processes with users├ö├ç├û knowledge and consent, notification of breaches by users, grievance redressal, etc. Such an application will aid in alerting individual users to verify whether it is necessary to upload or provide PII-containing document. Simultaneously, it will allow the personal data processing entity to check whether such PII document or data is required, and in case not necessary, help in removing, redacting or masking the PII
document or data from the uploaded or provided document or alerting the individual user regarding the same. This application would be useful for the purposes of data protection compliance, risk mitigation, enhanced security, improved data quality, operational efficiency, and legal and regulatory compliance.

Expected Solution:
A software application or library package to detect and alert users when there is personally identifiable information (PII) related to identified government-issued identification documents (Aadhaar card, PAN, Driving License to start with) embedded in the uploaded documents or providing data, while uploading or reviewing. In addition, the software application may be placed in public domain and shall allow the receiver of the document in removing, redacting or masking the PII from the document and data, if required.OrganizationMinistry of Electronics and Information TechnologyDepartmentCo-ordination DivisionCategorySoftwareThemeBlockchain & CybersecurityYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1668,Problem Statement Title,"Creating an application to identify the presence of government issued personally identifiable information (PII) embedded in documents and data, inadvertently or otherwise.",https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,security

Background. UIDAI is exploring possibilities to enable Face authentication on the desktop in a browser context. The proposed architecture to provide Face
Authentication in the browser context,requires AI on the edge to perform liveness check of the face being captured by the webcam or connected camera. UIDAI is considering the injection of ML model by using an appropriate binary code delivery mechanism.
The security of these models is important for transaction integrity and therefore seeking an innovative solution that will protect the model from any tampering and
reverse engineering.
2. Problem Description. As part of the challenge, participating teams to demonstrate model security in a browser context by using either obfuscation or
cryptography. Models are typically 5~7Mb in size and structured as flatbuffers. These models would be downloaded, when for the first time accessed on a desktop and then cached in the browser context. For subsequent face authentication transactions, a cached model would be preferred, unless otherwise the model has changed or updated.
To solve the above problem statement, teams are free to choose either ONNX web runtime or Tensor.js or any other innovative model to distribute the model in the
browser context.
The proposed solution must meet the following functional objectives.
1 Model Security. The solution must provide a mechanism to protect the model from any reverse engineering or tampering.
2 Model Size Optimisation. The solution must not significantly increase the size of the model post-implementation of security frameworks. Models are
expected to be downloaded in 3G/4G/5G wireless networks and hence any increase in size may lead to deteriorated user experience.
3 The solution must feature backend components to prepare the ML model either using obfuscation or cryptography. The backend activity can be a one-time
task during the release of the ML models or a just-in-time approach. In the just-in-time approach, the model would be obfuscated or encrypted before being downloaded to the end user├ö├ç├ûs desktop.

These devices/application come with vulnerabilities from time to time. There should be timely information sharing mechanism by which the concerned equipment users at critical sector orgs should be altered regarding any critical / high severity vulnerabilities in their equipment within the shortest possible time. Detailed description: The ICT components (HW/SW) being used by Critical Sector Organisations become vulnerable from time to time. These vulnerabilities can be categorised as Critical, High, Medium and Low. Any exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause havoc in multiple Critical Sector Organisations where such vulnerable equipment are being used. Keeping in view of the above, there is a need to monitor all such vulnerability information published at the equipment├ö├ç├ûs OEM websites and also other relevant websites. Once a critical or high severity vulnerability information is published at OEM website or any other relevant website, the ├ö├ç├┐to be developed scrapper├ö├ç├û will immediately take that vulnerability input along with possible mitigating strategy published in the website and send the information to predefined email id(s). Note: The NVD website publishes such OEM vulnerable information. But the same comes with a time lag. It is therefore needed to get such information directly from OEM websites and /or from other relevant websites where such vulnerable information is published almost in real time. Expected Outcome: An automatic script using open source tools to be developed for the OEM vulnerability information scrapping and reporting.

Over a time, model will learn and have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data in any sought format.
Description: The proposed solution is a natural language processing (machine learning) based redaction tool. The tool will redact or obfuscate from original data leaving the output structurally/logically the same but stripped of key identifiers and other content which may in any way allow the identity, actual data, markers or issues in the input content to be revealed. The correlational logic may be appropriately obfuscated based on the degree of redaction. This will have an easy to use GUI and will be available for use on online and offline systems.
The degree of the redaction will be up to the user- the higher the degree set by the user, the more the degree of redaction. This will work with all different commonly used formats for text and data sets. Security of data will be assured by ensuring that the input data is not stored or retrievable in any fashion by third party entities. User will have complete control over the input data.
It is also an important aspect that sometimes data may be required to be stored or submitted, however specific sensitive details may not necessarily be required. In such a situation- anonymized data authenticated as having being redacted from original would suffice.
Declassification processes are long and arduous; anonymization is largely manual or custom script driven. By providing a gradational redaction option, ordinary users can strip away the specificity to the extent of liking-from merely name removal/anonymization to completely synthetic data with only faint traces of original structure/pattern. This can allow generation of large number of databases with realistic but anonymized data that can be shared for learning, growth and commercial ventures.

creation.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1708Problem Statement TitleTool for secure automatic network topology 
creation.DescriptionBACKGROUND: 
In a SCADA system, for a pipeline network spanning thousands of kilometres, the network devices (both layer 2 and layer 3) are spread all along the geographical area. With such a large network, it becomes crucial, from both the maintenance and security point of view, to continuously monitor the complete network topology. Automatic topology discovery provides a complete and up-to-date map of all devices, connections, and pathways within the SCADA network. This comprehensive overview is essential for network administrators to understand the network's structure and dynamics. It ensures that any changes in the network, such as new devices being added or existing ones being removed, are automatically detected and documented in real time. When issues arise, knowing the exact layout and connections within the network helps in pinpointing problems more quickly, reducing downtime and improving response times. More significantly, automatic topology discovery helps in identifying unauthorized devices or unexpected changes in the network, which could indicate security breaches or cyber-attacks and allows for better network segmentation and implementation of access controls, limiting the spread of potential threats and protecting critical assets. Conventionally, automatic topology discovery tools utilize Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). However, these protocols are vulnerable due to lack of authentication, broadcast of sensitive information, etc. and hence are not suitable for use in a critical pipeline SCADA network.
Problem Statement Details:
├ö├ç┬úDevelop a tool for automatic network topology discovery, for a network using EIGRP routing protocol, that does not rely on CDP or LLDP protocols. The tool may use secure SNMPv3 polls/traps, ARP/MAC tables, NetFlow, routing protocol or syslog data for creating the automatic network topology. The challenge is accurate device identification without relying on the broadcast capabilities of CDP/LLDP and determining the physical and logical connections between devices. It must have a provision to keep the topology map updated with real-time changes in the network along with scalability to ensure that the solution works efficiently across small to large-scale networks. The most important component is to maintain network security to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage during the discovery process.├ö├ç├ÿ

216,National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC),"Recovery of Deleted Data and Associated Metadata from XFS and Btrfs Filesystems×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1749Problem Statement TitleRecovery of Deleted Data and Associated Metadata from XFS and Btrfs FilesystemsDescriptionBackground : Digital evidence has become increasingly crucial in forensic investigations. The recovery of deleted data from storage devices is essential for reconstructing timelines, identifying suspects, and uncovering critical information. Traditional file systems like FAT and NTFS have been extensively studied, and tools for recovering deleted data from them are relatively mature. However, modern file systems like XFS and Btrfs, designed for performance and reliability, employ complex data structures that pose signifycant challenges for data recovery.
Forensic investigations often involve recovering various file types, including documents files, log files, and system files. These files contain valuable information about system activities, user behaviour, and potential criminal activities. The ability to recover deleted files along with their complete metadata, such as creation, access, modification, and deletion timestamps, is crucial for establishing timelines and corroborating evidence.
Detailed Description :XFS and Btrfs file systems offer advanced features like journaling, copy-on-write, and efficient data allocation. While these features enhance system performance and data integrity, they also complicate the process of recovering deleted data. When a file is deleted in these file systems, the data itself is not immediately erased; instead, the file system marks the allocated blocks as free for reuse. This delayed overwriting of data presents an opportunity for recovery, but it also requires specialized techniques to extract and analyse the deleted data.
Moreover, recovering accurate metadata associated with deleted files is equally challenging. Metadata is critical for establishing the context of the recovered data and determining its relevance to the investigation. Extracting metadata from XFS and Btrfs file systems requires a deep understanding of their internal structures and data allocation mechanisms.
Expected Solution: An ideal solution would be a comprehensive data recovery technique specifically designed for XFS and Btrfs file systems. These techniques should able to:
1. Efficiently recover deleted data: Develop algorithms and techniques to identify and extract deleted files from the complex data structures of XFS and Btrfs.
