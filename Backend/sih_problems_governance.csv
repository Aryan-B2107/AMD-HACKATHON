98,Government of NCT of Delhi,"To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model for electricity demand projection including peak demand projection for Delhi Power system×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1624Problem Statement TitleTo develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model for electricity demand projection including peak demand projection for Delhi Power systemDescriptionBackground:
The load profile of power requirement in NCT of Delhi is highly peculiar. We are witnessing huge load variations during the winter and summer months and also during day and night during the same 24-hour window. This causes imbalance in matching the requisite power purchase with the electricity demand.
Description:
The peak load in Delhi touched 8300 MW this summer while the minimum load during winters goes as low as 2000 MW. The peak during the summer months also occurs twice i.e. first during the day time at about 15:30 hrs and second time in night hours after 23:00 hrs.
Further, the solar generation comes during the day time and wanes by the evening hours thereby lending a Duck-curve effect. Solar plants have been allowed +/- 15% variation by CERC. Further, there is uneven load growth in the city, the upcoming areas are witnessing huge load growth while the developed areas are having the lower organic load growth. In addition to that the load curve in Delhi is highly peaky in nature due to the fact that most of the load is domestic and commercial load while industrial load is minimal. Here it may be taken note that while in other States, industrial load which is 24 x 7 in nature lends stability to the overall load curve of the State. Further, in Delhi agricultural load is minimal. In bigger States, having considerable agricultural load, the supply on agricultural feeders is normally given when ample power is available at cheaper rates, especially during early morning hours/ night hours, which in -turn provides stability to the State' Transmission and Distribution network and also balances power purchase stipulation. Most of the Long Term power is available RTC (Round the Clock) and Slot-wise power is more expensive.
Expected Solution:
An Artificial Intelligence based model be developed with suitable compensation methodology to factor the weather effects (like temperature humidity, and wind speed, rains/showers), public holidays/ weekly holidays, natural load growth, and real estate development.OrganizationGovernment of NCT of DelhiDepartmentIT Department, GNCTDCategorySoftwareThemeSmart AutomationYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1624,Problem Statement Title,To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model for electricity demand projection including peak demand projection for Delhi Power system,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,governance

222,Ministry of Communication,"Data Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at the Divisional Level for DoP
 ""The Divisional Office as the nerve centre of administration, governance and control over the widespread national postal network requires a robust monitoring, analytics, visualisation and feedback mechanism to take advantage of digitisation and data driven governance.""×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1755Problem Statement TitleData Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at the Divisional Level for DoP
 ""The Divisional Office as the nerve centre of administration, governance and control over the widespread national postal network requires a robust monitoring, analytics, visualisation and feedback mechanism to take advantage of digitisation and data driven governance.""DescriptionBackground: The Department of Posts (DoP) runs a vast network of over 1.65 lakh post offices to deliver a wide range of services in mail and parcel, payments, financial and banking services and retailing of citizen centric services for ease of access and improving the quality of life around each post office. This vast country wide network is managed through the Divisional Offices which are the fulcrum of all activities in post offices within their jurisdiction. With IT Modernization and digitization of processes across its network, there is a wealth of data to govern the DoP in its current context. However, adequate capacity in this direction at the Divisional level has not been developed and the oversight on the postal units in each division is a combination of inspections, visits and web-based reporting in various priority project areas taken up by the Department during the course of the year (financial inclusion drives, Ghar Ghar Tiranga, Swachhta Abhiyaan etc). As it works towards a mature digital and data driven governance model with the Division as the focal point for continuous oversight over priority parameters of network health and performance, DoP seeks a capable Data Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at Divisional and higher levels. This DISU, as recommended by the Government of India for all departments under the Data Governance Quality Index and related initiatives, can leverage data to improve service delivery and achieve strategic goals.
A well-designed DISU will empower DoP to become a data-driven organization. This will lead to:
Ôö¼├Ç Improve service delivery: Optimize mail delivery routes, predict potential delays, and proactively address customer concerns.
Ôö¼├Ç Reduce operational costs: Identify areas for resource optimization and cost reduction through data-driven insights.
Ôö¼├Ç Enhance strategic decision-making: Gain data-backed insights into customer behavior and market trends to develop targeted strategies.
By scaling up the solution developed for one Division, DoP can establish a DISU in each of its Divisions as well as higher formations at the Regional, Circle and Headquarters level. This is a key building block of the new governance model that the DoP seeks to implement alongside its digital modernization over the years, specially in the wake of IT Modernization 2.0 project which is launched for the Branch Post Office network and would be launched in the remaining post offices during 2024-25.
Description: The challenge involves  designing a comprehensive hardware and software solution for establishing a scalable, future-proof DISU at the Divisional Office and higher levels. This solution should address three key areas:
Ôö¼├Ç   Data Acquisition and Integration: Develop a system to seamlessly collect data from existing DoP sources and integrate it with potential new data streams (e.g., IoT sensors, social media sentiment analysis).
Ôö¼├Ç   Data Processing and Storage: Implement a scalable and secure data processing pipeline to handle the growing volume and variety of data. Explore cloud-based storage solutions for efficient data accessibility and disaster recovery.
Ôö¼├Ç   Advanced Analytics and Insights: Develop robust analytics capabilities to extract valuable insights from the data. This includes utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for predictive maintenance, route optimization, and customer experience analysis.
Ôö¼├Ç    Data Visualization and Reporting: Design user-friendly dashboards and reports to translate complex data into actionable insights for informed decision-making at all levels within DoP.
Ôö¼├Ç  Scalability and Adaptability: The solution should be adaptable to accommodate future growth in data volume and evolving business needs of the DoP.
Ôö¼├Ç    Security and Compliance: Ensure data privacy and security through robust data governance practices and compliance with relevant regulations.
Expected Solution: Seeking innovative proposals that leverage a combination of hardware and software solutions to build a state-of-the-art DISU. (Interested knowledge institutions can take the challenge in coordination with the Divisions convenient for each of them.)
Hardware:
Scalable servers: To handle the growing volume and complexity of data.
Secure network infrastructure: To ensure data integrity and protection.
Sensor integration: Explore the integration of IoT sensors in key mail processing centers to gather real-time data on mail movement.
Software:
Data lake platform: To store and manage diverse data sets in a raw, unprocessed format.
Data integration tools: To seamlessly connect with existing systems and external data sources.
Machine learning and analytics libraries: For data analysis, model development, and visualization.
Business intelligence (BI) platform: To create interactive dashboards and reports for informed decision-making.
Additional Considerations:
Propose solutions that are cost-effective and can be implemented in a phased manner.
Address data security and privacy concerns to ensure the safekeeping of citizen information.
Design the solution for ease of use by DoP personnel with varying technical skillsets.
This challenge provides a unique opportunity to create a future-proof DISU that will empower DoP to become a data-driven service leader to enable the national development agenda with its all encompassing work with all stakeholders (Bazaar, Samaj and Sarkar).OrganizationMinistry of CommunicationDepartmentDepartment of PostsCategoryHardwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1755,Problem Statement Title,"Data Insights and Strategic Unit (DISU) at the Divisional Level for DoP
