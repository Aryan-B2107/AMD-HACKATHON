129,Ministry of Earth Sciences,"Development of a versatile and fast algorithm for the optimal ship routing×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1658Problem Statement TitleDevelopment of a versatile and fast algorithm for the optimal ship routingDescriptionBackground: Most of the goods are transported around the world by shipping which relies heavily on fossil fuels for powering. Given the expenditure of the shipping industry on the fuel, a main objective of a shipping company is to optimize the ship route for the least fuel consumption. Depending on the type and purpose of the voyage, it is also desirable to optimize several other parameters such as, the travel time, passenger comfort and route safety, to avoid any damage to the ship, cargo, crew and passengers. Optimization of each of these parameters serves a purpose. For instance, an energy efficient route may not be safe in terms of weather. Therefore, to avoid loss of life and property, route weather safety needs to be considered. An application suggesting the optimal route based on the chosen set of optimal parameters for any voyage between two ports in the Indian Ocean, will immensely benefit the Indian shipping industry.
Description: At the heart of any optimal ship routing application lies the optimization algorithm. Although scientific literature is available on various methods of optimizing the ship routes, given the commercial potential, there are no applications available publicly which can be customized for the Indian Ocean region. The optimization methods reported in literature range in complexity, computation time, versatility, etc. Various factors, such as, the forcings (surface winds, currents and waves), design of the ship and ship drift characteristics, impact the ship├ö├ç├ûs motion at sea. The optimal route must be continually evolving because the weather conditions keep changing as a ship proceeds on its voyage. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable optimization method that can optimize several parameters for a range of ships (with varying type, dimensions, drift characteristics of a ship) and develop an algorithm to return an optimal route within a reasonable computational time. The algorithm can optimize for the voyage time and safety to begin with but with a scope for addition of more optimization parameters.

Develop a telematics solution to enable efficient trucking operations for the long haul to connect the country through route optimization, live tracking and monitoring, optimal capacity utilization analysis and to enable appropriate response.DescriptionBackground: The Department of Posts operates 76 national routes under All India Road Transport Network (RTN). Commercial trucks of 5-14 tonnes capacity ply on these routes carrying parcels and mail. There are also state or intra-circle routes operated through a combination of commercial and departmental trucks for carrying parcels and mail. 
Description: The RTN trucks, operating on various routes, touch intermediate points, where parcels and mail are off-loaded and loaded. The capacity utilization of the trucks fluctuates depending upon the volume of parcels/mail being carried by it [illustration: On the Ahmedabad-Ajmer-Jaipur route, Ahmedabad loads the truck up to 80% capacity for Ajmer. At Ajmer, 20 % of the volume is offloaded, and 30% loaded, bringing total loading to 90% capacity (80-20+30 = 90). Similarly, at Jaipur, 40% volume is offloaded and 50 % loaded, bringing total loading to 100% (90-40+50= 100)]. Real time data is required for optimal utilization of truck capacity and adequate planning. In order to monetize spare capacity, integration with 3PL partners for capacity sharing through API (as described in the previous point) is also required. 
RTN trucks traverse a fixed route with specific touch points. The trucks may be delayed due to various factors, such as vehicle breakdown, poor traffic conditions, detours, detention at one or more touch points etc. GPS, geofenced locking should be enabled for any detours or delays so that alerts may immediately be triggered for verification and corrective action in time. Live tracking of trucks, with points of delay is required for efficient and timely movement of parcels and mail in the value chain. 
There should be a system for dispatch and schedule management as per live data automatically populated and analyzed in real time. Any changes or deviations should automatically flow into the system so that schedules, which are downstream, automatically get updated and adjusted to the delay in real time. 
All data should be captured and populated automatically, and relevant MIS reports generated automatically with visualization where relevant.

E-commerce organisations like Amazon,Flipkart, financial organisations like ICICI, HDFC etc are providing door step products/services with use of advanced technology like digital platform or machine learning through AI. This creates another level of acceptance across the world among the recipient for the organisation. This is becoming part of basic customer expectation and needs to be included in the Department├ö├ç├ûs common value proposition with the help of a robust system tied to its operational system. 
Description: India Post as the largest mail delivery organisation in India delivers articles/parcels at the door step of customer. The delivery is one of the key services the Department offers to the citizens of India. Department reaches last mile of delivery through its branches. The delivery process initiates at the booking Post office after receiving mails/articles. After sorting, the concerned Postman of the delivery Post Office has to reach to the recipient for delivering article mostly during the office hours, i.e. in between 10am to 5pm. In many instances, recipient cannot receive the article within that time range of the delivery due to his absence at the delivery address. In that case i) Post man either has to make 2nd attempt or next day delivery which falls within same time range orii) after unsuccessful delivery Postman has to serve intimation for next day delivery or for window delivery at Post Office by the recipient personally. In both cases, wastage of valuable working hours of the Postman happens for sure. Moreover, due to such incident, recipient has to take leave from his/her work as delivery time range/slot gets coincided with his/her working hours for collecting the article. In many cases article gets returned to sender because of non-availability of the addressee within time range of Postman delivery.
This creates dissatisfaction on the delivery service among both Sender and Receiver of the article/consignment, thus lowering departmental performance index. Hence Department is losing the extra mile of delivery performance in the eye of customer of modern era as well as e-commerce like product oriented organizations who uses last mile unique delivery system of this organisation.
Expected Solution: -
At time of booking of any consignment sender should have option to select time slot for delivery and share the same with the recipient which can be modified by the sender online at any point of time before the date of delivery.
Whenever recipient will receive sms/alert about the consignment to be delivered at his/her end with the mentioned time slot, the recipient should have the option/flexibility to make change of time slot online before the day of delivery.

 ""This is to overcome  challenges faced by philatelists across India and to design a solution that enhances their experience and fills up gaps in access to information, raising demand and ensuring fulfillment as per interest for each Philatelic item and ancillaries released and made anywhere in the country through a web based community and a National Philately Deposit Account.DescriptionBackground:
One of the primary concerns for philatelists in our country is the limited access to philatelic material released nationwide. Currently, each postal circle releases its own material, catering primarily to philatelists within its respective jurisdiction and immediate reach. Consequently, philatelists from other circles often find it challenging to obtain such material. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness regarding ancillary releases among the philatelic community nationwide.
Description:
To address these issues, the development of a comprehensive website dedicated to philately, which would serve as a centralized platform for philatelists across India is the prospective solution suggested.  This website would facilitate the creation of a National Philately Deposit Account, enabling philatelists to access philatelic material released pan India. Other supporting mechanisms to strengthen the community can also be thought of and integrated to the main solution. 
Expected Solution:
The proposed website would offer the following features:
Centralized Platform: The website would display philatelic material released by all postal circles across India, ensuring that philatelists have access to a wide range of items.
Online Ordering and Payment: Philatelists would be able to order and pay for philatelic material online through the website, streamlining the purchasing process and eliminating geographical barriers.
Standard Postal Services: Postage for ordered items would be charged at the standard rates for Registered/ Speedpost services, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery.
 Cancellation Releases: Information regarding cancellation releases would be made available on the website, allowing philatelists to obtain cancellations on postal stationery through the website. Rates for such services can be determined accordingly.OrganizationMinistry of CommunicationDepartmentDepartment of PostsCategorySoftwareThemeTransportation & LogisticsYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1762,Problem Statement Title,"Building a National Web Community of Philatelists

238,"Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), MHA","Indigenous logistics Drones to enhance operational & logistic capability×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1774Problem Statement TitleIndigenous logistics Drones to enhance operational & logistic capabilityDescriptionBackground: ITBP is a border guarding force deployed along Indo China Border which is high altitude mountainous terrain, remote & sparsely populated area. Prevailing sub zero temperature in deployment area coupled with low atmospheric pressure & high wind speed drastically reduces output of human as well as electronic equipment as compared to plains/semi plains areas. Further deployment of ITBP is valley based which is connected through main land by narrow road/track which remain cutoff due to prolonged winter/monsoon season. Thus unique & harsh climatic condition coupled with poor road connectivity in remote mountainous area make it quite impossible to deploy cutting edge equipment which are readily available in the Indian market.  In such conditions, logistic sustenance including supply of essential medicine & fresh ration becomes difficult, time consuming and risky, which ultimately affects morale of deployed force personnel and their operational efficiency. Logistic Drone can be useful in the delivery of life saving medicines, essential equipments, fresh ration, small arms and ammunition, important manuals and documents etc.  Description:  The above Problem Statement envisages, that Logistic Drone be developed to transport 35-40 Kg logistic supplies such as life saving medicines, medical equipments, water, fresh fruits and vegetables and other critical resources to ITBP troops deployed at remote forward area. Logistic Drone with payload capacity of 40 Kg can significantly reduce delivery time and cost in area having poor road infrastructure or which remain cut-off during prolonged winter and monsoon season.  Expected solution:  A Logistic Drone capable to transport 35-40 Kg payload at high altitude area (9000 ft- 16000 ft) and stable against high wind speed (40-70 Km/Hr.). The flying endurance should be more than 75 minutes and mission range should be more than 20 Kms (one side) with total endurance to fly minimum 40 Km without change of battery, the Logistic Drone can be powered by battery, fuel, solar/combination of any two of these. Operating altitude should be up to 1500 mtr (AGL) at high altitude area. The operating temperature range should be -35 degree C to 55 degree C. The area required for taken off/landing should not be more than 15 mtr x 15 mtr.OrganizationIndo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), MHADepartmentIndo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP)CategoryHardwareThemeRobotics and DronesYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1774,Problem Statement Title,Indigenous logistics Drones to enhance operational & logistic capability,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,transportation
