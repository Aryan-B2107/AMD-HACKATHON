119,Ministry of Culture,"Online Chatbot based ticketing system×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1648Problem Statement TitleOnline Chatbot based ticketing systemDescriptionBackground:
Visitors to museums often face several significant challenges due to manual ticket booking systems. One prominent issue is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours, weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance, double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.
Description:
The implementation of a chatbot for ticket booking in a museum addresses several critical needs, enhancing the overall visitor experience and streamlining museum operations. Here are the key reasons for adopting a chatbot ticket booking system:
1. Improved Customer Service
2. Efficient Handling of High Volumes
3. Cost-Effective Solution
4. Data Collection and Analysis
5. Accessibility
6. Reduced Human Error
7. Multilingual Support
8. Enhanced Marketing and Promotion
Expected Solution:
An efficient and responsive multilingual chatbot based ticketing system that can handle all kinds of bookings from gate entry to shows. Payment gateway should also be integrated to make it fully free from human intervention. It will also provide analytics to aid in more efficient decision making process.OrganizationMinistry of CultureDepartmentNational Council of Science MuseumsCategorySoftwareThemeTravel & TourismYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1648,Problem Statement Title,Online Chatbot based ticketing system,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,tourism
127,Ministry of Earth Sciences,"Development of a mobile application to provide recreational suitability information of beach locations across India.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1656Problem Statement TitleDevelopment of a mobile application to provide recreational suitability information of beach locations across India.DescriptionBackground: Coastal tourism is one of the priority areas highlighted in the Draft Blue economy policy of India. As such, use of technology to improve the tourism and related sectors is the need of the hour. Given the expected increase in the coastal tourism of our country, there is a need to ensure safety of the tourists. In this regard, a mobile application indicating the suitability of beaches for recreational activities (based on the current ocean state like wave heights/ocean currents, meteorological parameters like wind, water quality etc.) will be a useful value addition to the coastal tourism sector.
Description: The proposed app should be able to provide tourism suitability (say suitable/not suitable based on various parameters) at a particular point of time across various beaches in India.
Create locations of different beaches across the country.
Different parameters to be considered to determine suitability of a coastal location for recreation activities like Ocean alerts (High Wave/Swell Surge/Ocean Currents/Storm Surge/Tsunami), Winds, Water quality assessments. These parameters will be available via INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services) API.
The application should devise a method/algorithm to use the above parameters and make the safety/suitability decision at the different locations.
Visualization using geospatial maps and colour codes based on suitability of locations.
Based on the current location of the user, alert notifications to be provided in case of any alerts in the coastal location of the user) to be provided
Expected Solution:
Design and development of a mobile application which identifies suitability of coastal tourism sites based on the current weather and oceanic conditions.
This can help to save lives and better plan the coastal tourist/recreational activities for the user.OrganizationMinistry of Earth SciencesDepartmentIndian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)CategorySoftwareThemeTravel & TourismYoutube LinkDataset LinkThe oceanic alerts information will be available via REST API.

150,National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO),"Centralized Automated Solution for Price Estimation & Reasonability.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1682Problem Statement TitleCentralized Automated Solution for Price Estimation & Reasonability.Description2.1 Background:
2.1.1 Procurement is an essential component of any project. There are set rules and procedures to undertake various kinds of procurements. Each procurement methodology has several milestones, which too need careful planning and execution, to avoid time and cost over runs.
2.1.2 As such, Government procurements are driven by the General Financial Rules (GFRs) and the Manuals for Procurement of Goods and of Services. Needless to say, all procurements are made keeping in mind transparency, fair competition amongst vendors as well as cost reasonability for the product services, as public money is involved.
2.1.3 One of the important methodologies often employed in procurement processes is establishing the ├ö├ç├┐price reasonability├ö├ç├û for a certain product/service. This methodology is generally applied at two stages, viz. while obtaining administrative approval for procuring the said product/service, and before opening the commercial bids of qualified vendors.
2.1.4 The process of ascertaining the price reasonability of any product/service of interest is commonly known as Price Benchmarking.
2.2 Detailed Description:
2.2.1 There are various strategies to benchmark the cost. Some of them are as follows:
i. Sometimes, the cost of the product or the rate at which service is to be hired are already defined by the Government. For example, labor rates.
ii. It may be possible that a similar product/service has been procured by the department in recent past. This can be taken as reference, known as the Last Purchase Price.
iii. When none of the above is known, the most prevalent technique to gather information about the approximate value of the product/service is Market Survey.
2.2.2 Market Survey may be carried out physically by a team, as the name suggests, by actually visiting the market. However, this practice is only feasible for common goods/services such as stationery, common electrical appliances (AC, Fan, Lights etc), common services (sanitation, horticulture, maintenance etc). In case of sophisticated systems like Networking Solutions, Communication Systems, Sensors, Payloads and other Electronic Systems, this method does not work. In such cases, the market survey is carried out from information available in public domain.
2.2.3 This presents a complex problem. Information about prices of items which are used in abundancy by various departments (e.g. routers, switches, Hard Disk Drives, Laptops, Workstations, Graphics Cards etc), are available in the public domain, generally speaking. On the other hand, Information about prices of not so common items (e.g. Microwave Devices, Waveguides, Transmission Lines, Antennae, HF/VHF equipment, Software Defined Radios, etc) may or may not be available, resulting in a hit- and-trial approach).

2.2.4 Therefore a web-based application, which can assist various teams to tabulate the approximate price of products/services from various sources from information available in public domain, would be very useful. The contours of such an application is explained in subsequent paragraphs.
2.3 Expected Solution:
2.3.1 The solution will be web based. Users will first register themselves and thereafter use it, through their login credentials. The application interface will be simple without unnecessary graphics and multimedia for quick loading and fast responsiveness.
2.3.2 The users can query the applications either by providing the exact make/model or the most relevant specifications in case of Products, or by providing general information in case of Services.
2.3.3 Based on the inputs provided by the user, the application will use an appropriate method to crawl the web and gather information, which will then be presented to the user. The minimum input fields and the expected output fields are explained below, for various scenarios.
