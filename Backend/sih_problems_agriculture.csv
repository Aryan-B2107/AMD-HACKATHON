45,Ministry of Jal Shakti,"Drone-based Intelligent ET sensing system and irrigation water use accounting system for irrigation commands.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1571Problem Statement TitleDrone-based Intelligent ET sensing system and irrigation water use accounting system for irrigation commands.DescriptionBackground: The use of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) technology for estimation of seasonal Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of crops at various growth stages is well establishd. Due to low levels of water metering in irrigation, it is challenging to control theft from canals and unauthorized ground water extractions. Therefore, ET based technologies can enforce water accounting / auditing and thus enhance Water Use Efficiency (WUE). 
However, the EOS based ET technology has certain limitations i.e. low accuracy under cloudy conditions and low resolutions. Therefore, the drone-based ET systems can be used to bridge this data gap. 
Description: The idea is to estimate the actual water consumption by the crops (i.e. AET) in a targeted irrigated command area (ranging from 50 Ha to 5000 Ha) with the help of a drone based system. This system should have a portable drone control module along with an in-built Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI&ML) mechanism to work out AET and calibrate against the satellite-based ET inputs. Once integrated with cadastral maps, it should be tailored for individual farm level water control. 
Expected Solution: A drone fitted with suitable ET sensing system to bridge the data gaps/limitations from Satellite based ET system for calculation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) of different crops under survey. The AI&ML algorithm using historical data and satellite based inputs should be able to give various Key Performance Indicators (KPI) at farm level like (i) Type of Crop; (ii) Crop monitoring (seeding/sowing/harvest/ disease etc); (iii) Water Auditing/Water Accounting: (iv) Over irrigated vs under irrigated/Ground water use; etc. 
These KPI's can provide an insight of farmer irrigation decision-making; estimation of irrigation water use; farmer irrigation behavior heuristics and management practices, including the scheduling and efficiency of irrigation decisions. The software model can be polished over time in different irrigation commands to improve the accuracy and reliability of irrigation water use estimation. This will give a complete control of water use and agriculture productivity at field through remote sensing and help in increasing the Groundwater Level in critical unsafe areas.OrganizationMinistry of Jal ShaktiDepartmentDepartment of WR, RD & GRCategoryHardwareThemeRobotics and DronesYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1571,Problem Statement Title,Drone-based Intelligent ET sensing system and irrigation water use accounting system for irrigation commands.,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,agriculture

Description
Design a game for a Hackathon event that enhances participant engagement, fosters planning, and develops a better Panchayat/Village development
The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help villagers/youth, etc. to prepare a village development plan. A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the

village using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ├ö├ç├┐Farmville├ö├ç├û kind of a game for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input.
Key Components to include for the game app:
Budget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning.
Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction, establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc.
The basic steps of the Game broadly involve: -
i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers.
ii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network, etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development plan is required.
iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world visualization of the village.
iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of
drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc.
v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity
as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats.
vi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features.
vii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed.
viii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform.
ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform.
A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: -
Case1: Road laying activity

├ö├ç├│ The player selects the start point and endpoint with intermediate points wherever required for road construction. It needs to validate that any road laying activity may not be a duplicate road construction plan.
├ö├ç├│ The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of the road etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game. Based on
changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should be regenerated.
├ö├ç├│ Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be auto generated.
├ö├ç├│ Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders.

Case 2: Streetlight

├ö├ç├│ The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added based on the game artefacts.
├ö├ç├│ The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp, based on the lamp change ├ö├ç├┤ the changes to reflect on the game for best results.
├ö├ç├│ Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated.

Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side.

├ö├ç├│ The player selects the village for developmental activity.
├ö├ç├│ The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected village.
├ö├ç├│ The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension of the house along with roof type area.

Expected Solution
Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times, exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan to
develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat development plan activities.
├ö├ç├│ A detailed game outlining the work model.
├ö├ç├│ Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface.
├ö├ç├│ Documentation on implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the gamification system into the Hackathon event.
1. Article 243G of the Constitution of India acknowledges Panchayats as institutions of local self-government and mandates them to prepare plans for economic development and social justice. As local government, Gram Panchayats (GPs) are responsible for delivery of basic services to local citizens and address the vulnerabilities of poor and marginalized ones. This can only be achieved through implementation of well thought out plans through efficient and responsible utilization of available resources.
2. An efficient and robust planning process as part of GP├ö├ç├ûs core functioning becomes necessary. GP development plan should ideally match people├ö├ç├ûs needs and priorities with the available resources. It should be prepared through a fair, inclusive, transparent, and participatory process. The focus should be on local development issues, local perception of need and priority, local analysis of problems and solutions, and local resources management all within a collective local vision.
3. Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP) to be prepared for effective implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of National importance.
The formulation process of Panchayat Development Plans (PDP) must be comprehensive and based on participatory process, which inter alia involves the full convergence of the schemes of Central and State Governments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution.
4. A need was felt to take forward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) up to the last mile, i.e., up to the GP level, leveraging a wide network and strong institutional mechanism of third tier of Government including Traditional Bodies of non-part IX areas.
Accordingly, the Ministry has adopted a thematic approach aggregating 17 SDGs into 9
broad themes for Localization of Sustainable Development Goals (LSDGs) at grassroot
level through Panchayats adopting ├ö├ç├┐Whole of Government and Whole of Society
Approach├ö├ç├û and the PDPs will be prepared adopting thematic approach to achieve
localization for SDGs in rural India.


29 Subjects defined in the Eleventh Schedule

Description
Design a game for a Hackathon event that enhances participant engagement, fosters
planning, and develops a better Panchayat/Village development
The objective is to create a gamified experience that can help villagers/youth, etc. to

prepare a village development plan. A simulated environment is needed to develop a self-
sustained village development plan game where the user can plan various facilities in the

village using the resources available. It is envisaged to develop ├ö├ç├┐Farmville├ö├ç├û kind of a game
for a village. Developers can use any game development platform to create the game for
android platform. SVAMITVA Scheme GIS data maps of villages will be provided as input.
Key Components to include for the game app:
Budget Estimate: Functionality to add the estimate for each type of activity for which
planning is required. For example, if new/extension road needs to be constructed for the
gram panchayat / village, it should allow us to add the budget for road feature planning.
Work Model: Development of a game for taking up works under Gram Panchayat
Development Plan (GPDP) such as road construction, drainage construction,
establishment of toilets, streetlights, etc.
The basic steps of the Game broadly involve: -
i. Select the village, where development plan is required by the villagers.
ii. Based on the input received such as the village building footprints, road network,
etc., develop the 3D visualization of the existing village for which development
plan is required.
iii. Superimpose the SVAMITVA Scheme maps/drone data to have a real-world
visualization of the village.
iv. Developmental activities would provide the list of activities that a plan would be
composed. For example, a new road laying for a stretch in the village, laying of
drainage pipeline for the village, drinking water pipeline for all the villagers, etc.
v. There is resource envelope/money available with Panchayats under different
Schemes for different types of developmental work. Once the development activity
as in point iv above is planned in the game, the amount shall be deducted from the
Resource Envelope allocated to Panchayats.
vi. Generate a more realistic 3D model with other existing features.
vii. Arrive at a tentative estimate for the planning being performed.
viii. Ability to provide a walkthrough of the 3D platform.
ix. Ability to provide a fly-through of the 3D platform.
A few examples of probable use cases are indicated below: -
Case1: Road laying activity

├ö├ç├│ The player selects the start point and endpoint with intermediate points wherever
required for road construction. It needs to validate that any road laying activity may
not be a duplicate road construction plan.
├ö├ç├│ The player can select the type of the road, width of the road; height of the road
etc., based on the selection, the road should be built in the game. Based on
changing the parameters like type of road from BT road to cement road, it should
be regenerated.
├ö├ç├│ Once the road construction is done by the player, cost of construction should be
auto generated.
├ö├ç├│ Ability to measure the road dimensions and road shoulders.

Case 2: Streetlight

├ö├ç├│ The player selects the road where streetlight is required. The streetlight is added
based on the game artefacts.
├ö├ç├│ The player has option to check the light illumination based on the time of the day
for best location for streetlight along the road. Option to change the type of lamp,
based on the lamp change ├ö├ç├┤ the changes to reflect on the game for best results.
├ö├ç├│ Once finalized, the cost estimate of the street lighting to be generated.

Case 3: Ability to measure the building height and width of each side.

├ö├ç├│ The player selects the village for developmental activity.
├ö├ç├│ The player is presented with a 3D simulated environment representing selected
village.
├ö├ç├│ The player can measure the height of building and all sides to create the dimension
of the house along with roof type area.

Expected Solution
Panchayats have been the fulcrum of local self-government since ancient times,
exercising both executive and judicial powers over village-level issues. We plan to
develop a virtual 3D environment-based gaming platform for village/Panchayat
development plan activities.
├ö├ç├│ A detailed game outlining the work model.
├ö├ç├│ Prototypes or mock-ups of the game platform/interface.
├ö├ç├│ Documentation on implementation guidelines and best practices for integrating the
gamification system into the Hackathon event.
These are few of the cases described by this concept.

A robust system to segment, target and focus on each customer based on their needs from time to time is needed for India Post to direct its service force to make efforts in response to such needs.""DescriptionBackground: The Department of Posts has implemented various Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) Schemes in All over India uniformly. However, each socio-geographic formation at the state, district, block and village level has its own demographic realities that require a customised thrust for making the relevant financial and insurance services available to the served population around each post office.  For example,  in West Bengal, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher where if Melas for Sukanya Samriddhi Accounts ( SSA) and Mahila Samriddhi Samman Patras (MSSC) can be arranged, the effectiveness of the sales effort and the conversion rate will be higher. Similarly, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher and higher  number of Senior Citizen Social Security (SCSS) accounts can be opened for their benefit to justify presence of post offices in these areas. But there is no such report from where it can be identified, where and when the need of which product is higher. All melas like SSA, MSSC, Postal Life Insurance (PLI) , Rural Postal Life Insurance ( RPLI)  have been arranged in villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child and senior citizens resulting in moderate to mediocre success for the efforts.  
Description: The Department of Posts has implemented various POSB Schemes in All over India uniformly. Actual demographic location-wise population is to be identified. In West Bengal, for example, there are some villages where percentage of females are higher, in some villages the number of senior citizens are higher. In some sectors demand young generation and service holders are much higher. The need of the youth and service holders are very different from the demands of other sector of people. Density of farmers and business-oriented people are higher in some areas.  All melas like SSA, MSSC, Public Provident Fund (PPF), Recurring Deposits (RD), Time Deposit ( TD)  PLI, RPLI have been arranged in every city and villages without the knowledge of percentage of male/female/child/senior citizens and other sectors of people and as a result the success of all the melas are found not satisfactory. 
Expected Solution: The expected solution is pictorial data and actual demographic and economic location-wise population is to be identified.  The demographic and location-wise population data is to be taken as a fundamental data towards improvement of financial (banking & insurance) services.OrganizationMinistry of CommunicationDepartmentDepartment of PostsCategorySoftwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1760,Problem Statement Title,"AI based identification of Financial (Banking & Insurance) needs based on demography and economic / farming Cycle

However, the nutrient content of F/L OM can vary widely, often being insufficient to meet the needs of various crops. Enrichment of F/L OM with additional nutrients or through enhanced fermentation processes can significantly improve its efficacy as an organic fertilizer. Despite this potential, current enrichment methods are often too costly or complex for small farmers to implement, limiting their ability to fully benefit from F/L OM.
 
 Expected Solution: The creation of low-cost, scalable enrichment models for F/L OM that can be easily adopted by small farmers. These models should focus on enhancing the nutrient content of F/L OM through affordable additives or optimized fermentation techniques. The goal is to produce a more potent and consistent organic fertilizer that can boost crop yields while remaining accessible and practical for village-level production.OrganizationMinistry of Jal ShaktiDepartmentDepartment of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS)CategoryHardwareThemeClean & Green TechnologyYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1768,Problem Statement Title,GOBARdhan - Low-cost enrichment models for F/L OM (Fermented / Liquied Organic Manure),https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,agriculture
