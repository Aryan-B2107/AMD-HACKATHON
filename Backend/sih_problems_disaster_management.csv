80,Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL),"Micro-Doppler based Target Classification×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1606Problem Statement TitleMicro-Doppler based Target ClassificationDescriptionDescription: The world today has bought on a need to pay increased attention to safety and security issues, for example, search and rescue operations, surveillance, and protection of critical infrastructure. These tasks are often labour intensive and potentially dangerous. This provides an incentive to create systems that aid operators to gain situational awareness. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles, pose a significant threat to privacy and security. To understand and assess this threat, classification between different drone models and types is required. One way in which this has been demonstrated experimentally is through this use of micro-Doppler information from radars. Normally birds and drones are often confused and there is need for a method which clarifies their corresponding class.
Background: Due to substantial increase in the number of affordable drones in the consumer market and their regrettable misuse, there is a need for efficient technology to detect drones in airspace. Drone and birds both include micro-Doppler signatures due to their propeller blade rotation and wing beats respectively. These distinctive features can then be used to differentiate a drone from a bird, along with studying them separately.
Detailed Description:
Classification of drones and non-drones using micro-Doppler signatures captured from Radar as a sensor. Moving parts of an object produce modulated Doppler components called micro-Doppler. The modulated Doppler signature is presented as added components to the Doppler signature of the drone body. Due to rotating blades, frequency modulated components, which are quite revealing, are produced. To observe the time varying micro-Doppler├ö├ç├ûs, received FMCW should be processed by Joint time-frequency analysis.
A Conventional air surveillance radar system(operating usually at L-Band or S-Band) can rely on the radar cross section(RCS) of an aircraft for detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection, but this may not always provide reliable detection in case of drones. Even if a dedicated system is built to be sensitive enough to detect small object like a drone, just RCS information is not adequate. Birds have similar physical size to drones and also will fly at similar altitude and speeds. A reliable drone detection radar system must have the capability to discriminate between a drone and a bird. And hence micro-Doppler signature analysis is the key parameter for classification.

Input: The micro-Doppler signatures of drones and bird

Digitalised system will ensure that all red flags are properly briefed and major actions which needs to be taken in the next shift is communicated to the shift in charge of next shift beforehand so that he can mentally prepare for the same.
This will save time in the forthcoming shift and ensure better productivity. It will also ensure better safety and monitoring of the mine.
Every mine has to prepare a Safety Management Plan (SMP) as per DGMS guidelines. This SMP is based on Hazard identification and devising control and monitoring mechanism and fixing responsibility. This SMP implementation needs to be digitalised in the software for better management of risks. 
Also, this app or web based solution needs to be integrated with ERP software. While designing the software, due care should be given to data security. 
Possible Solution:
An app and web based application can be developed for every type of log book currently in use by supervisors and operators in mining operation and digitalising the Safety Management Plan currently being implemented by mine owners as per DGMS guidelines.
Also the application should be able to streamline communication by automatically converting shift logs into organized PDF reports.OrganizationMinistry of CoalDepartmentCentral Mine Planning & Design Institute LimitedCategorySoftwareThemeSmart AutomationYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1645,Problem Statement Title,An app and web based software for Productivity and safety management of coal mines.,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,disaster_management
