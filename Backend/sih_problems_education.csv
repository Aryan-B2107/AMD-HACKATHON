53,Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment,"Developing writing pen and writing pad for children with Specific learning disability.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1579Problem Statement TitleDeveloping writing pen and writing pad for children with Specific learning disability.DescriptionBackground: Children with Specific Learning Disability (SLD)who faces challenge of writing during their academic life especially during examinations where they need the provisions of a scribe. The purp ose of rehabilitating people with disabilities is to reduce the dependence on other people. In order to achieve this fundamental right to be independent, it is important to develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing penand writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential. The innovative technology or solution should be cost effective and easily usable so that children with all strata can afford to use this.
Detailed Description: In India, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other educational boards provide several relaxations for students with learning disabilities (SLD) during examinations such as having a scribe during exams. A scribe writes answers as dictated by the child. The scribe must be from a lower grade than the child appearing for the exam. CBSE provides remuneration for the scribe, and you can also apply for your own scribe if needed. If a child has difficulty reading, they are entitled to a reader who reads (not explains) the questions to the child. However, a child can have either a reader or a scribe, not both. CBSE grants additional time to students with disabilities. For example:
60 extra minutes for a three-hour exam
40 extra minutes for a two-hour exam
30 extra minutes for a one-and-a-half-hour exam.
Since January 2020, CBSE allows the use of calculators for children with dyscalculia. The board provides these calculators.Theseaccommodations aim to create a level playing field for students with learning disabilities, ensuring they can demonstrate their knowledge effectively during exams. However it has some disadvantages as well like some students may become overly reliant on scribes, affecting their independent writing skills.Students may feel uncomfortable dictating their answers to someone else. Availability of trained scribes can be a challenge, especially during exams. The quality of scribing may vary, impacting the accuracy of the student├ö├ç├ûs responses. Also some of the people are misusing the benefits by training or teaching the scribe rather than the child with SLD to write the exam and score good marks.
Expected Solutions: To develop innovative strategies and solutions to come up with some hardware tools like writing pen and writing pad for children with specific learning difficulties so that their academic life does not become a hurdle in realising their full potential.

It was also accepted that these SDGs are not possible to achieve without changing humanity├ö├ç├ûs relationship with the oceans. To realize that, in 2017, it was decided that the decade of 2021-30 is to be observed as UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development (or UN Ocean Decade). INCOIS is identified as UN Ocean Decade Collaborative Centre for the Indian Ocean Region to help address all the ten UN Ocean Decade challenges (https://oceandecade.org/challenges/).

Description: The creative solution proposed herein will address mainly (but not limited to) challenge-10. The gamified way of creating ocean related awareness is aimed for all age-groups and diverse education levels. Considering popularity of online gaming (multi-role playing to conventional games such as ludo) and affordable devices along with data plans, this approach is promising option for ocean literacy. For a starter, one such solution (but very limited/basic in nature) can be found at: https://www.outreachgames.org/OceanProtector/main.html.

Expected Solution:
The user will be able to chose from a variety of sea-going roles e.g. but not limited to, fishermen, captain of a ship, tourism operator etc. Based on the role, one needs to choose the correct sea conditions to be at a location (or move away) with the help of available/applicable ocean information services form INCOIS (simulated for the game). Correct decision (e.g. going for fishing to PFZ zone or moving away from the shore when tsunami is detected) will add to the points and help player achieve next level. Wrong decision may result in loosing points and add other gaming penalties (e.g. start over or wait till certain time etc etc). Users goal would be to advance and maintain gains at the daily, weekly etc leaderboards so in that way it would be competitive among the users even though their game decisions are not affecting to the others directly.

209,Ministry of Education,"Standardizing Odd School Structures to Improve Educational Policy Implementation and
Resource Allocation×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1742Problem Statement TitleStandardizing Odd School Structures to Improve Educational Policy Implementation and
Resource AllocationDescriptionBackground:
ODD School Structure refers to schools that do not conform to the standard categories
defined by the Ministry of Education under the UDISE+ portal. These standard categories are
designed to align with the Samagra Shiksha framework, which aims to ensure uniformity
and consistency in the educational structures across the country. Schools falling outside
these categories, due to variations in grade configurations, are classified as having """"odd
structures.""""

However, 145,012 schools across the country fall into the """"odd"""" school structure category
due to variations in grade configurations. These odd structures pose challenges for the
uniform implementation of educational policies and schemes, such as Samagra Shiksha. This
misalignment is particularly significant in states like Goa, Mizoram, West Bengal, and Kerala,
where the majority of schools do not conform to the standard categories.

Description:
The problem of odd school structures affects the equitable distribution of resources,
effective policy implementation, and the overall quality of education. Schools with odd
structures are often excluded from the streamlined processes and benefits that come with
standardization. The national average of schools with odd structures is 14.28%, but in some
states, the percentage is much higher, complicating the delivery of educational initiatives.
The objective is to standardize these odd school structures by aligning them with the
defined categories under Samagra Shiksha, thereby improving the uniformity and
effectiveness of educational policies across the country.

Innovative Solutions:

A. AI-Driven School Structure Analysis Tool: Develop software that uses AI to analyze
school data and automatically classify schools into standard categories or identify
them as odd structures. This tool can also suggest optimal restructuring options to
align schools with the standard categories.
B. Standardization Support Platform: Create a platform that provides guidelines, best
practices, and resources for schools to transition from odd to standard structures.
The platform could include modules on infrastructure planning, grade
reconfiguration, and community engagement strategies.
C. Dynamic Resource Allocation System: Develop a system that allows for flexible
resource allocation based on school structures. This system would help in
distributing resources more equitably by taking into account the specific needs of
schools with odd structures during the transition period.
D. Progress Monitoring Dashboard: Implement a real-time dashboard for monitoring
the progress of schools as they transition from odd to standard structures. This
dashboard would provide insights to policymakers and administrators, allowing them
to track changes, identify bottlenecks, and intervene as necessary.
E. Interactive Stakeholder Engagement Portal: Develop an online portal to engage with
school administrators, teachers, and the community. This portal could include
forums, feedback tools, and support resources to facilitate the transition to standard
structures, ensuring that the process is inclusive and addresses local concerns.OrganizationMinistry of EducationDepartmentSamagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Department of School Education & Literacy (DoSEL)CategorySoftwareThemeSmart AutomationYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1742,Problem Statement Title,"Standardizing Odd School Structures to Improve Educational Policy Implementation and

├ö├ç┬ú The wide, evolving delivery network of the Post Office makes it difficult for customers to write the correct pin code on the postal items for delivery. The Post Office also merges Pincodes together to mechanise and streamline delivery in the emerging volume and mix of mail handled at different stages, including the point of delivery. An intelligent solution, powered by AI is needed to meet the dynamic design of the supply chain both for customers as well as operators within India Post.DescriptionBackground: The Department of Post in India boasts the world's largest postal network, with over 165,000 post offices. Through nearly 19,000 pin codes across the country the postal network manages the delivery of postal items across its network. One common issue is the mismatch between the specified Delivery Post Office name and the area PIN code on mail items, leading to delays and customer dissatisfaction.The delivery network design keeps on evolving as Nodal Delivery Centres and Delivery Hubs are introduced to bring in more efficiency in operations. From the perspective of the customer, the challenge is two fold: (a)  to know the correct Pin Code, which is itself a challeng; (b) the dynamic nature of operations inside with merged pin codes etc for all or certain categories of mail is also a challenge. Though the customer does not need to bother about (b), the internal system of India Post needs to take care of both issues (a) and (b) for efficient and correct delivery at all times.    
Description: Postal services are essential for various government, financial, educational, corporate, and public entities, both in urban and rural areas. Despite the widespread use of postal services, inaccurate addressing persists, hampering efficient delivery. Each mail item must clearly indicate the recipient's Delivery Post Office name and area Pin Code. However, inconsistencies in this information often result in misrouted mail, with approximately 5% of articles handled daily at distribution hubs containing incorrect Pin Codes. Even if correct Pincodes are provided as per information available with the customer, there is a mismatch in the internal operations as the constant upgradation of delivery network with Nodal Delivery Centres with merged pincodes etc makes it too dynamic for internal operators to keep pace with the changes. This leads to mistakes, delays and wasteful movement of mail pieces in the system. 
Expected Solution: An AI-based scanning solution is proposed to identify the correct delivery location for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. This system will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office based on available data. By automating the identification process, this solution aims to improve last-mile delivery efficiency, reducing delays and enhancing customer satisfaction. Having taken care of the first problem, the system is also expected to align with internal operational databases for clubbing and mapping of different pincodes for delivery purpose and thereby suggest the right destination for dispatch and delivery of the articles.OrganizationMinistry of CommunicationDepartmentDepartment of PostsCategorySoftwareThemeTransportation & LogisticsYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1758,Problem Statement Title,"AI-Powered Delivery Post Office Identification System
