23,Department of Science and Technology,"Development of innovative design for flushing systems in western toilet sheets which can be used for deployment in public toilets.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1546Problem Statement TitleDevelopment of innovative design for flushing systems in western toilet sheets which can be used for deployment in public toilets.DescriptionBackground: Public toilets are essential for maintaining hygiene in urban areas, but they often face challenges such as high usage, maintenance issues, and water wastage.
Description and Expected Solution: An innovative public toilet design is required so that maximum usable area gets cleans during the flushing and can be automated in a mechanized form (not electronic), so that after the usage, the flushing system gets activated automatically, and the whole usable area gets cleaned.OrganizationDepartment of Science and TechnologyDepartmentDepartment of Science and TechnologyCategoryHardwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1546,Problem Statement Title,Development of innovative design for flushing systems in western toilet sheets which can be used for deployment in public toilets.,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,smart_city
59,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"Development of Portable EMI/EMC, induction measurement Instruments.×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1585Problem Statement TitleDevelopment of Portable EMI/EMC, induction measurement Instruments.DescriptionBackground: In Metro network various electronics cards and equipment are installed which have to work nearby high voltage power supply, therefore the functioning of these cards may be affected due to the EMI/EMC generated due to above power supply. Therefore, the measurement of EMI/EMC in environment is essential requirement in metro system; however, traditional measurement instruments for these parameters are often bulky, expensive, and require specialized skills to operate so need to develop portable EMI EMC meter
Description: The problem statement aims to develop a series of portable meters for measuring electromagnetic interference (EMI), induction, torque, and adhesion, catering to the needs of diverse industries. These portable meters will be compact. lightweight, and user-friendly. allowing for easy deployment in various environments and applications.
The EMI meter will be capable of detecting and analyzing electromagnetic emissions from electronic devices, machinery, and infrastructure to assess their compliance with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards. It will feature advanced signal processing algorithms to identify and quantify EMI sources accurately.
Expected Solution: The proposed solution will involve the development of a series of portable meters for measuring EMI/EMC parameters. These meters will be designed to be compact, lightweight, and rugged, suitable for use in various industrial environments. Additionally, the meters will feature wireless connectivity options for data transmission and integration with existing systems and workflows.
By providing portable meters for EMI/EMC measurement, the proposed solution will enable organizations to enhance product quality, improve operational efficiency, and ensure compliance with industry standards.OrganizationMinistry of Housing and Urban AffairsDepartmentSmart Cities MissionCategoryHardwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1585,Problem Statement Title,"Development of Portable EMI/EMC, induction measurement Instruments.",https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,smart_city
193,Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,"Utilization of aerial/ drone-based images for monitoring of progress of construction activities for building construction projects×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1726Problem Statement TitleUtilization of aerial/ drone-based images for monitoring of progress of construction activities for building construction projectsDescriptionBackground: The monitoring of physical progress of construction activities requires a technical expert to visit and observe the site. Due to large number of projects in Indian cities, field visits by technical experts for weekly/daily monitoring becomes non-feasible. A machine learning based solution, which can identify the status of construction activities based on images, can allow the ULBs, stage agencies, and central agencies to monitor physical progress daily, or even in real time. Description: The problem requires a machine learning based software solution in which aerial/drone-based images from sites of ongoing road construction projects can be processed, to identify the stage of construction. As the road construction activities include multiple components and stages in construction; the software can take inputs regarding (type of activity, exact road stretch (from which location to which location) etc.), to identify the type of algorithm to be used to analyze the images.  For different components of construction activities, different machine learning algorithms will need to be developed with training using images from road construction site. While similar monitoring solutions are required for all types of projects, the current problem statement only includes ""road construction projects"", to keep scope of problem statement limited and assess the feasibility of similar solutions in future. Expected Solution: A software solution utilizing machine learning algorithm to identify stage of road construction works or progress of construction activities from uploaded site images, which should be able to: - Allow users to upload images and provide information regarding type of activity to be assessed (installation of utility ducts, macadamization, road construction, installment of pedestrian infrastructure, etc.) -Analyze the images and describe the construction activity, stage of construction, and road lengths for which different components have been completed. -Compare status of road construction with previous site images and provide data regarding progress of work. -Raise error in case of incorrect image/details have been uploaded and ask the user for necessary corrections.OrganizationMinistry of Housing and Urban AffairsDepartmentSmart Cities MissionCategorySoftwareThemeSmart AutomationYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1726,Problem Statement Title,Utilization of aerial/ drone-based images for monitoring of progress of construction activities for building construction projects,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,smart_city
