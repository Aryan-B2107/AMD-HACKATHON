128,Ministry of Earth Sciences,"Integrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access System×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1657Problem Statement TitleIntegrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access SystemDescriptionBackground:
INCOIS provides fishery advisory services to fishermen through potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories that proven to benefit fishing communities by making fishing more economical and reducing fuel consumption, as fishermen can directly target areas with abundant fish. Current research is focused on advancing the fisheries forecasting services through developing species-specific advisory services. However, predicting species-specific abundance requires a deep understanding of the habitat suitability of commercially important species. This requires analyzing fish catch data alongside environmental variables at the locations of fish occurrence and abundance, identifying the most important variables contributing to their abundance, and ultimately fitting these data to appropriate prediction models. INCOIS is striving to collect geo-referenced fish catch data from various sources, including data from other research Institutions, industry collaborators, research cruises, and a dedicated app that captures fisheries information through images from fish catch locations. However, at present there is no systematic mechanism to aggregate and store these information from multiple channels to a single data base. As a result, the data is highly scattered and disaggregated, leading to wastage of time and confusion among scientific personnel developing species-specific habitat suitability models, since this disorganization makes it difficult to access all available datasets for analysis.
Detailed Description:
Considering the difficulties in collecting georeferenced fish catch data, each single dataset is highly crucial for habitat suitability models. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive database to store all available georeferenced fish catch information with appropriate filters and visualization tools. This would enable dedicated personnel to easily access and download all data available for a particular species. Such a dataset would also be highly beneficial for new scientists interested in working on different species, resulting in species specific advisory services for more species in future. 
Data input, classification and arrangement 
The software solution for the portal should handle input data in Excel format and organize it by date, location, depth, and species. Some datasets provide the weight of individual species, while others are only the aggregate weight of the catch with only the information on presence of individual species, not their catch weights. Therefore, there should be separate modules for occurrence and abundance of species. The module for abundance should store data that includes catch weight of individual species, while the module for occurrence should store data with and without catch weight.
Users, Data output and visualization
The users of the portal will primarily be scientific personnel working on specific species or multiple species, interested in visualizing and downloading data for their target species. Therefore, the portal should display search results for a species using appropriate maps and graphical formats, and also allow users to download the data in Excel/CSV format with columns for Date, Species, Latitude, Longitude, Catch Weight, and Depth.
-In some instances, scientific personnel may also be interested in studying the fish assemblage patterns of multiple species within a particular geographical area over time. Thus, the output filters should also allow users to filter data by area (using latitude and longitude bounds) and display the occurrences and abundances of all available species over different time scales, along with relevant data on their depth of occurrence.
Data Accessibility
The Data repository should have an admin page to continuously update the database, and users should be able to login with appropriate credentials to access the data.
Expected Solution: A comprehensive data base to feed, arrange, store and visualize disaggregated data on fish catch. This would make research towards species-specific fisheries forecasts hassle-free and smooth, saving time and effort in collecting and compiling information, allowing researchers to focus on more productive tasks.OrganizationMinistry of Earth SciencesDepartmentIndian National Center for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)CategorySoftwareThemeSmart AutomationYoutube LinkDataset LinkDummy Data sets will be provided during the grand fiNAleContact info",Problem Statement ID,1657,Problem Statement Title,Integrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access System,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,environment
130,Ministry of Earth Sciences,"Data download Duplication Alert System (DDAS)×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1659Problem Statement TitleData download Duplication Alert System (DDAS)DescriptionBackground: In an institute environment, multiple users often require access to the same datasets for various purposes. However, due to lack of communication or visibility, these users may unknowingly download duplicate copies of the same data. This leads to unnecessary consumption of resources, including bandwidth and storage, and complicates data management. The DDAS (Data download Duplication Alert System) addresses this issue by notifying users with an alert if a potential duplicate download is identified. This system helps optimize resource usage, save time, and streamline data management processes.
Description: Managing data downloads efficiently is crucial for optimizing resources and maintaining order in any organization. A DDAS addresses the issue of multiple users inadvertently downloading duplicate copies of the same datasets across various fields.
The DDAS operates by maintaining a repository or database that records metadata of all downloaded datasets. This metadata includes details such as file names, sizes, timestamps, and download locations. When a user initiates a download request, the system checks the database to determine if the dataset has already been downloaded by any user. To identify duplicates accurately, the system uses file history or unique identifiers, ensuring duplicates are detected even if file names differ.
If a potential duplicate is detected, the system prompts the user with an alert. This alert provides comprehensive information about the existing dataset, including its location and the timestamp of the original download. By doing so, the DDAS helps users avoid unnecessary downloads, thereby optimizing resource usage, saving time, and streamlining data management processes.
This system is designed to be flexible and applicable across various fields and industries, including academic institutions, research facilities, and any other domain where efficient data management is critical. By preventing duplicate downloads, the DDAS ensures that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall organizational efficiency.
Expected Solution: To mitigate this issue, a robust solution is needed to design and develop a system that generates alerts when users attempt to download data already available within the institute's repository or any of the user accounts. The alert system should promptly notify users about the existence, properties (such as the period, spatial domain, and other relevant data attributes), and location of the required data, thereby preventing unnecessary duplication and promoting efficient resource utilization. Implementing this solution allows organizations to streamline data access processes and reduce redundancy.

Excess untreated water entering the Ganga river systems transports high organic and pathogen loads. Their use generates high levels of pollution with significant organic loads, with very high Biochemical Oxygen Demand. This will inevitably lower Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in rivers, thereby threatening fisheries and biodiversity (maacroinvertebrates). At the same time, the high sewage discharges affect the suitability of the river for bathing due to the higher levels ofpathogens in rivers. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of rainfall events, this is becoming a significant problem, threatening the water quality and ecology of Ganga river system. The societal impact of providing forecast data that is easily and openly accessible will change how we see and value our rivers and enable citizens to make better decisions based on better data for our health and the health of the rivers of Ganga Basin.
Description: An AI-enabled decision support system may be developed to Integrate data from multiple sources such as satellite data, IOT-based sensor-generated data, intrumental meteorological measurements, in-situ flow, water quality observations, and miltiple hydrological & hydrodynamic models to work together in real-time to generate historical patterns of behaviour and water quality forecasts for Ganga River.
Model source code can be seamlessly incorporated into a cloud platform infrastructure. The models may receive daily inputs of current and forecasted precipitation and temperature data that drive real-time observations, may be stored in a time series database and automated workflows continually check observations against forecasts. The observed data may act as ground truth and help fine-tune the model's parameters and predictions. This dynamic calibration process may endure the system adapts to changing environmental conditions. The entire workflow may operate within a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, making it accessible to a wide range of users and organization. Users can access the daily water quality forecasts through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing them to set up early warning alert and conduct scenario modeling.
The overall strategy for the forecasting scheme synthesizes satellite data collected across the basin or watershed which is them linked to a model chain to generate flow and water quality data at key locations down a Ganga river system. The daily time series of flow and water quality data can then be displayed online or via a mobile app, to show recent and past changes in water quality. The system should forecast future flows and water quality, up to 3-5 days ahead. This then provides a warning system for operational managers who might want to switch supplies if a significant pollution pulse is moving down the river system. Also, rather like weather forecasts, a probability can be assigned to any forecast, so that users can evaluate predictions in terms of a familiar risk assessment. Regulatory agencies can make use of the system and App to help validate environment agency sampling at locations of interest that are not formal sample points for compliance, and for tracking pollution incidents that occur along river systems.
Expected Solution: 1. To prepare an AI-enabled decision support system with focus on predictive and adaptive (query based) solutions. A mobile app is envised that utilizes satelliter data to procduce real-time forecasts of flow and water quality using hydrological & hydro dynamical models at multiple locations in a river network.
a. To create historical simulations of flow and water quality, as well as a three to 5 day ahead forecast at any location down the Ganga River, and to provide a tool that scientists, managers, or the general public might use.
b. Dashboard may show the following options 
i. Ganga River set up a map with options for plotting flow, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, DO,BOD,Fecal Coliform and; etc.
ii. It may show a time series plot of paramenters such as rainfall, flow, DO, BOD, Fecal Coliform and nitrate for the Ganga River over the past 10 days and a forecast ahead of 3 days.
2. Alrets can be sent out to decision makers providing notice of an extreme event, e.g., pollution discharge, combined sewer pverflows discharges, high pathogen events, or a pulse of high nitrate water moving down the river system.

198,MathWorks India Private Limited,"SolarQuest: Innovate to Capture More Sunlight and Boost Energy×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1731Problem Statement TitleSolarQuest: Innovate to Capture More Sunlight and Boost EnergyDescriptionAs the global shift towards renewable energy intensifies, solar trackers, which adjust solar panels to follow the sun├ö├ç├ûs path, are crucial for maximizing solar energy efficiency. Consequently, it is essential to design controllers for solar trackers that can optimize the angle of incidence between solar panels and sunlight. This tracking of the sun├ö├ç├ûs trajectory can be done accurately by managing at least one mechanical axis (azimuth, elevation, roll). As a preliminary step, a simulation-based control system, using tools such as SimscapeTM MultibodyTM and SimulinkÔö¼┬½, can be designed with a single-axis control based on location-specific solar paths. The workflow would involve integrating an electrical motor model (developed using tools like SimscapeTM ElectricalTM), designing a PID control system, developing an algorithm for optimal axis positioning, and validating the system through simulation. In the subsequent steps after validation, the motor control system can be deployed on low-cost hardware (e.g., using SimulinkÔö¼┬½ Support Package for Arduino) to demonstrate a prototype of this solar tracking mechanism.
