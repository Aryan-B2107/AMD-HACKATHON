However, the sun├ö├ç├ûs position changes throughout the day and across seasons, which can reduce the amount of sunlight that fixed solar panels receive.
Description: Traditional solar tracking systems often rely on electrical components and motors, which can be costly and require maintenance. A non-electrical tracking system offers a sustainable and low-maintenance alternative to enhance the efficiency of solar panels.
Expected Solution: The problem statement is to develop a cost-effective, non-electrical device that can accurately track the sun├ö├ç├ûs movement and adjust the orientation of solar panels to maintain optimal exposure. This device should be reliable, easy to install, and capable of operating without external power sources.OrganizationDepartment of Science and TechnologyDepartmentDepartment of Science and TechnologyCategoryHardwareThemeRenewable / Sustainable EnergyYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1545,Problem Statement Title,"Development of a non-electrical device for tracking the movement of the sun for movement of the solar panels, increasing their efficiency.",https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,others
37,National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO),"Automatic Change detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1563Problem Statement TitleAutomatic Change detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagesDescriptionBackground: Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images have the capability for night time imaging as well as imaging without being affected by clouds. Automatic change detection on such images have wider application for various use cases.
Description: Change detection between two SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite images are straight forward if they are co-registered as the difference or ratio of corresponding pixels of the two images itself will give the change map. But such change maps will invariably have many natural changes as well like water body extent, flood extent, snow cover and forest cover changes etc. Our interest is to detect only man made changes and avoid natural changes.
The solution can make use of Sentinel 1 SAR Open source satellite images and Google Earth Engine platform to access them. These images are co-registered by default. The GRD (Ground Range Detected) intensity image version of the Sentinel 1 SAR is to be used. Please note that images with same viewing geometry are better suited for change detection purposes. The solution should give the option for the user to vary the thresholds if any used for filtering change results. The change output should be in the form of polygons in a geographically referenced vector file. The solution should be scalable, means should be able to run on huge areas of interest and generate change alerts. The criteria for winning solution would be minimum false alarms with regard to man made changes.
Expected Solution: A software based solution is expected that has a GUI to specify the area of interest for change detection and threshold controls to filter changes and output changes in the form of shapefiles/geojson with geographical references. It shall run above Google Earth Engine.OrganizationNational Technical Research Organisation (NTRO)DepartmentNational Technical Research Organisation (NTRO)CategoryHardwareThemeSpace TechnologyYoutube LinkDataset Linkhttps://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPRNICUS_S1_GRDContact info",Problem Statement ID,1563,Problem Statement Title,Automatic Change detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,others

As a result of this water flows from such well automatically and pumping devices are not required. Such autoflow wells are observed mostly in the Terai region of India. As shown by the aquifer mapping studies, the extents of autoflow areas are shrinking in parts of Uttarakhand and elsewhere. 
Many private wells in these terrains are without any cap or tap and water flows continuously leading to huge groundwater losses. 
Further, measurement of head (water level) in these wells is a challenge as water flows automatically from these wells. Usually an additional pipe is attached above the ground level and the water level in such a pipes is measured manually. 
The proposal is to develop a device that can serve two purposes- i) it will work as a safe cap for the well with a tap for regulating water flow and ii) a pressure transducer based sensor that can sense the pressure and translate it in terms of height (in m) above ground levelOrganizationMinistry of Jal ShaktiDepartmentDepartment of WR, RD & GRCategoryHardwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1570,Problem Statement Title,Designing and development of a pressure transducer based equipment with a well cap for measurement of heads in autoflow wells,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,others

Ensure that variations in spelling or slight modifications do not bypass the similarity check (e.g., Namaskar vs. Namascar). d.        Calculate a similarity percentage for each title comparison.  2.        Prefix/Suffix Handling: a.        Maintain a list of disallowed prefixes and suffixes. b.        Reject any new titles that include these disallowed prefixes or suffixes if they cause the new title to resemble an existing title closely. 3.        Guideline Enforcement: a.        Maintain a list of disallowed words (e.g., Police, Crime, Corruption, CBI, CID, Army). b.        Ensure that titles containing these disallowed words are rejected. c.        Prevent the creation of new titles by combining existing ones (e.g., if ""Hindu"" and ""Indian Express"" exist, ""Hindu Indian Express is not allowed"").  d.        Check for titles with similar meanings in other languages and reject them (e.g., ""Daily Evening"" and ""Pratidin Sandhya""). e.        Disallow adding periodicity (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to existing titles to form new ones. 4.        Verification Probability: a.        Provide a probability score indicating the likelihood of a title being verified. 5.        Database Interaction: a.        Efficiently search and compare new titles against the database of 160,000 titles. b.        Track current applications and use them for future reference to reject similar titles submitted later. c.        Use indexing and optimised search techniques to handle the large dataset and ensure quick responses. 6.        User Feedback: a.        Provide clear feedback to the user if their submitted title is too similar to an existing title, contains disallowed prefixes/suffixes, violates guidelines, or is created by combining existing titles. b.        Display the verification probability to the user. c.        Allow the user to modify their title and resubmit it for verification. 7.        Scalability: a.        Design the system to handle an increasing number of titles and user submissions. b.        Ensure that the system remains performant as the database grows. Expected Solution: 1.        The system will provide the probability of a title being verified. For instance, if a title has a similarity score of 80%, the verification probability shall not be more than 100%-80%=20% 2.        The system will reject any new title that is too similar to existing ones, contains disallowed words or prefixes/suffixes, combines existing titles, or has similar meanings in other languages. 3.        The system will track current applications and use them for future reference, rejecting similar titles submitted later by other users. Acceptance Criteria: 1.        Accuracy: a.        The system correctly identifies similar-sounding titles and provides consistent results. b.        The system accurately rejects titles with disallowed prefixes, suffixes, and words. c.        The system prevents the creation of titles by combining existing titles and identifies titles with similar meanings in other languages. d.        The system disallows adding periodicity to existing titles. e.        The system provides an accurate verification probability score. 2.        Performance: a.        Title verification is completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds per title). b.        The system can handle multiple title verification requests simultaneously without significant performance degradation. 3        User Experience: a.        Users receive clear and actionable feedback on why their title was rejected. b.        Users see a probability score indicating the likelihood of their title being verified. c.        The interface for title submission and feedback is user-friendly and intuitive. 4        Robustness: a.        The system handles edge cases and variations in spelling effectively. b.        The system is resilient to errors and provides meaningful error messages when issues occur.OrganizationMinistry of Information and BroadcastingDepartmentMinistry of Information and BroadcastingCategorySoftwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset Linkhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13p8Z_XU9oJjzHiiJI8HSGBgFQFCOC76E?usp=sharingContact info",Problem Statement ID,1782,Problem Statement Title,An online system to automatically verify new title submissions by checking for similarities with existing titles,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,others

251,Madhya Pradesh Police,"Fuzzy Name conversion of Hindi Names in Police Records×Problem Statement DetailsProblem Statement ID1787Problem Statement TitleFuzzy Name conversion of Hindi Names in Police RecordsDescriptionThe police department handles a vast array of data including the names of individuals involved in various activities such as reporting incidents, being suspects. witnesses, or victims. A significant challenge arises with the accurate recording and retrieval of these names, especially when dealing with Hindi names. which can be represented in multiple ways due to variations in transliteration, spelling, and pronunciation.  Issues Faced 1. Inconsistent Transliteration: Hindi names often have multiple valid English transliterations. For example, the name Suresh in hindi could be written as ""Suresh"" or ""Sursh"". This inconsistency creates difficulties in searching and matching records accurately. 2. Spelling Variations: Minor spelling differences. such as ""Suresh"" vs. ""Sursh"", can lead to significant discrepancies in the database, resulting in incomplete or incorrect search results. 3. Phonetic Similarity: Different names that sound similar phonetically but have different spellings can be a challenge. For instance, ""Kumar"" and ""Kumaar"" may refer to the same individual but are treated as distinct entries in the system. 4. Data Entry Errors: Human errors during data entry can introduce further variations, such as typos or incorrect transliterations, making it harder to maintain accurate and consistent records. 5. Multiple Scripts: The use of both Devanagari (Hindi script) and Roman script adds another layer of complexity. A name recorded in Hindi may need to be searched in its English transliterated form. and vice versa. 6. Search Efficiency: Traditional search algorithms may not effectively handle these variations, leading to inefficiencies in retrieving relevant records during investigations or administrative processes  Impact on Operations  1. Delayed Investigations: Inaccurate name matching can lead to delays in criminal investigations as officers struggle to retrieve all relevant records associated with a particular individual. 2. Resource Wastage: Additional resources are required to manually cross-check and verify records that the system fails to match automatically, increasing operational costs and workload. 3. Legal Implications: Inaccurate or incomplete records can have serious legal implications, potentially affecting the outcomes of cases and leading to miscarriages of justice. 4. Public Trust: Inefficiencies and inaccuracies in handling sensitive information can erode public trust in the police department's ability to manage and process data effectively.  Solution Requirements 1. Fuzzy Matching Algorithms: Implement advanced fuzzy matching algorithms capable of handling variations in spelling, transliteration, and phonetic similarities. 2. Standardized Transliteration: Establish and enforce standardized rules for the transliteration of Hindi names into English inconsistencies. to minimize 3. Phonetic Search Capability: Develop search capabilities that consider phonetic similarities to improve the accuracy of name matching. 4. Error Correction Mechanisms: Integrate error correction mechanisms to identify and rectify common data entry errors. 5. Script Interoperability: Ensure seamless interoperability between Devanagari and Roman scripts to facilitate accurate searches across different scripts. 6. Training and Guidelines: Provide training to personnel on best practices for name entry and establish clear guidelines to minimize errors and inconsistencies. By addressing these issues, the police department can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of its name matching processes, leading to more effective law enforcement operations and improved public trust.OrganizationMadhya Pradesh PoliceDepartmentMadhya Pradesh PoliceCategorySoftwareThemeMiscellaneousYoutube LinkDataset LinkContact info",Problem Statement ID,1787,Problem Statement Title,Fuzzy Name conversion of Hindi Names in Police Records,https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2024PS,others
